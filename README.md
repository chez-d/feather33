# feather33
Feather form-factor board with a 1.4GHz quad-core A33 from Allwinner.

**Watch out!** I haven't tested this board yet. ***No guarantees*** on anything including DDR!!!
Any <=512MB DDR3L should work.

A 50p board-to-board connector is added to break out another USB, audio, and parallel RGB among other things

This board is designed to work with OSHPark's 6L service and to be assembled with a stencil and hotplate/hot air.
